This is a basic calulator.

I have used basic HTML/CSS/JS concepts to make this.

Handles elementry grade operations including: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. Very basic error handling has been implimented into the JavaScript. 

I will be expanding on this mini-project to improve and expand scope and functionalities.
